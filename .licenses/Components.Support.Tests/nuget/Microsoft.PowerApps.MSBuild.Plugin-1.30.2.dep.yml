    this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer

    RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You

    also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software.
    This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or
    country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in
    one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following
    provisions apply to you:\na)\tAustralia. You have statutory guarantees under the
    Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those
    rights.\nb)\tCanada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
    updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device
    from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software

    The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for
    your specific device or software.\nc)\tGermany and Austria.\ni.\tWarranty. The

    materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual
    guarantee in relation to the licensed software.\nii.\tLimitation of Liability.

    Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft
    is liable according to the statutory law.\nSubject to the foregoing clause ii.,
    Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach
    of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate
    the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the
    purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly
    trust in (so-called \"cardinal obligations\"). In other cases of slight negligence,
    Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.\n10.\tDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
    THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES
    NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER

    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n11.\tLIMITATION ON AND
    EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE
    PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS
    ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING
    CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.\nThis limitation
    applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including
    code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims
    for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence,
    or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable
    law.\nIt also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility
    of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because
    your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of
    incidental, consequential, or other damages.\n\nPlease note: As this software
    is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below
    in French.\nRemarque: Ce logiciel étant distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses
    dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.\nEXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE.

    ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité
    marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont
    exclues.\nLIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR
    LES DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation

    stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi
    en vigueur.\nElle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait
    connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion
    ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou
    de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus
    ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.\nEFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit
    certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les
    lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent
    les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.\n"
