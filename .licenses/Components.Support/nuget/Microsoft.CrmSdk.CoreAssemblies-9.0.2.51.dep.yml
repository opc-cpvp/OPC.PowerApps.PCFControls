    > **iii.** indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including
    attorneysâ\x80\x99 fees, related to the distribution or use of your applications,
    except to the extent that any claim is based solely on the unmodified distributable

    trademarks or trade dress in your application in any way that suggests your application

    or distributed in source code form, or that others have the right to modify it.\n\n**3.
    DATA**\n\n> **a) Data Collection.** The software may collect information about
    you and your use of the software and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use
    this information to provide services and improve Microsoftâ\x80\x99s products
    and services. Your opt-out rights, if any, are described in the product documentation.
    Some features in the software may enable collection of data from users of your
    applications that access or use the software. If you use these features to enable
    data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable law, including
    getting any required user consent, and maintain a prominent privacy policy that

    in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways;\n\n> **b)** reverse
    engineer, decompile or disassemble the software;\n\n> **c)** remove, minimize,

    AGREEMENT.** This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements,
    updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.\n\n**8.
    APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.** If you acquired the software in
    the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live
    (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern
    the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims
    (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless
    of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any other country,
    its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent
    to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington
    for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive
    jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all
    disputes heard in court.\n\n**9. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.** This
    agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including
    consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from
    your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the
    party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those
    other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For
    example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory
    country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:\n\n> **a) Australia.**
    You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in
    this agreement is intended to affect those rights.\n\n> **b) Canada.** If you
    acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off
    the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if
    and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking
    for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation,
    if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.\n\n>
    **c) Germany and Austria.**\n\n> > **i. Warranty.** The properly licensed software
    will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany
    the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to
    the licensed software.\n> > \n> > **ii. Limitation of Liability.** In case of
    intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act,
    as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable
    according to the statutory law.\n> > \n> > Subject to the foregoing clause ii.,
    Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach
    of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate
    the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the
    purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly
    trust in (so-called â\x80\x9Ccardinal obligationsâ\x80\x9D). In other cases of
    slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.\n\n**10.

    party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
    contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or
    other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable
    law.**\n\n**It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about
    the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply
    to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or
    limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.**\n\n**Please note:

    are provided below in French.**\n\n**Remarque: Ce logiciel Ã©tant distribuÃ© au
